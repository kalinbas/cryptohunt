# CryptoHunt
Crypto Hunts are real-life games where many people participate in a defined area (for example in the subway of a city) and during a given time. It has a simple dApp which lets you participate in the games. All actions are recorded on the blockchain. The winner wins real coins (which were paid as a registration fee from all participants).
